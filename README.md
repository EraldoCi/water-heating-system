# water-heating-system

> This is a project for a solar water heating system control and analysis.

## Idea

Build an simple API that can be used for reciving data from microcontrollers
and also send commands for any device.<br>

This project will contain a backend, microcontroller program and an interface.
The backend will be built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
The microcontoller program will done by using arduinoIDE or PlatformIO and Assembly.
And the user interface will be a graphical dashboard, so the user can track the
system response and eventually control the water heating system.

## Timetable

* February 1st -- February 6th

- [ ] Data sent from devices (firmware)

- [ ] Storaging measurement data (api)
